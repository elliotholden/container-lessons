# Lesson 1
### What are conatiners?
Containers are a lightweight and portable way to deploy applications. They provide a consistent and reliable way to package an application and its dependencies into a single container that can be run on any system that supports containers, without requiring a specific environment or dependencies to be installed.

Unlike a __vm__, instead of virtualizing an entire machine, it virtualizes the application and its dependencies. This makes containers much more efficient and lightweight than traditional virtual machines.

__NOTE:__ Think of a container the same way as when you run 
>systemctl start httpd

You are running *command* not a *virtual machine*
