To make a table in Markdown, you can use the following syntax:

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |
```

The `|` characters are used to separate columns, and the `-` characters are used to separate the header row from the rest of the table. You can add as many rows and columns as you need.

For example:

```markdown
| Name | Age | City    |
|------|-----|---------|
| John | 25  | New York|
| Jane | 30  | London  |
| Bob  | 35  | Paris   |
```

This would render as a table with three columns and three rows.

To make a line break in Markdown, you can use two spaces at the end of a line, followed by a return. This is called a "hard line break".

Alternatively, you can use a blank line to separate paragraphs. This is called a "soft line break".

Here's an example:

This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph.

In the code, this would look like this:

```markdown
This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph.
```

If you want to use a hard line break, you can add two spaces at the end of a line:

```markdown
This is the first line.  
This is the second line.
```

Note that some Markdown parsers may not support hard line breaks, so it's generally safer to use soft line breaks (blank lines) to separate paragraphs.

Yes, Markdown does support some HTML tags, including `<br>`. You can use HTML tags within Markdown text to add additional formatting or functionality.

In particular, the `<br>` tag can be used to insert a line break. For example:

```markdown
This is the first line.<br>
This is the second line.
```

This would render as two lines of text, with a line break between them.

Note that not all Markdown parsers support all HTML tags, so it's always a good idea to check the documentation for the specific Markdown parser you're using to see what HTML tags are supported. However, `<br>` is a commonly supported tag.

In a containerized environment, such as Docker, there are three different users that play a role in the container's lifecycle:

1. **Container namespace**: This refers to the namespace in which the container runs. A namespace is a way to isolate resources, such as processes, network interfaces, and mounts, from other containers and the host system. The container namespace is essentially the "root" of the container's file system and process tree.
2. **Login user for the container**: This is the user account that is used to authenticate and log in to the container. When you run a container, you can specify a user to use for login, using the `-u` or `--user` flag. This user account is used to set up the container's environment and run the initial commands. The login user is typically used for administrative tasks, such as setting up the container's configuration or running commands as a privileged user.
3. **User that starts the main process**: This is the user account that is used to run the main process (or command) inside the container. This user is specified in the container's `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` file, using the `USER` instruction. The main process user is the user that runs the application or service that the container is intended to provide.

To illustrate the difference, consider a container that runs a web server. The container namespace might be `/var/www`, the login user might be `root`, and the user that starts the main process might be `www-data`. In this case:

* The `root` user is used to log in to the container and perform administrative tasks.
* The `www-data` user is used to run the web server process, which is the main process of the container.
* The `/var/www` namespace is the root of the container's file system, where the web server's files and configuration are stored.

It's worth noting that the login user and the main process user can be the same, but they don't have to be. In some cases, you might want to use a different user for the main process to ensure that the application runs with the correct privileges and ownership.

No, the IMAGE ID will be different on the two computers.

The IMAGE ID is a unique identifier assigned to the image on the local Docker host. It's generated by Docker when the image is pulled or built, and it's used to identify the image on that specific host.

Even if you pull the same container image from the same registry on two different computers, the IMAGE ID will be different on each host. This is because the IMAGE ID is generated based on the local Docker host's configuration, such as the host's ID, the image's metadata, and other factors.

However, the IMAGE DIGEST will be the same on both computers. The IMAGE DIGEST is a unique identifier that is generated based on the image's contents, and it's used to verify the integrity of the image. Since the image contents are the same on both computers, the IMAGE DIGEST will be the same.

To illustrate the difference:

* IMAGE ID: `abc123` on Computer A, `def456` on Computer B
* IMAGE DIGEST: `sha256:abcdef123456` on both Computer A and Computer B

Note that the IMAGE ID is specific to the local Docker host, while the IMAGE DIGEST is a global identifier that can be used to verify the image's contents across different hosts.

The `USER` command in a Dockerfile sets the default user that will be used to run the container's main process. This user will be used to execute the `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` instruction in the Dockerfile.

When you use the `USER` command in a Dockerfile, you're setting the user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) that will be used to run the container's main process. This user will be used to own the process and its resources, such as files and network connections.

The `USER` command does not directly relate to the default user used when you "exec" into a container. When you use `docker exec` to run a command inside a container, you can specify a user using the `-u` or `--user` flag. If you don't specify a user, the command will run as the root user by default.

Regarding the `{{.User}}` field in the container image's JSON metadata, it refers to the user that was specified in the `USER` command in the Dockerfile. This field is used to store the user ID and group ID that were set by the `USER` command.

Here's an example of how the `USER` command and the `{{.User}}` field relate:

Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
USER 1001:1001
CMD ["echo", "Hello World"]
```
In this example, the `USER` command sets the default user to `1001:1001` (UID:GID). When you build the image and inspect its metadata, you'll see the `{{.User}}` field set to `1001:1001`.

Container image metadata (JSON):
```json
{
  "User": "1001:1001",
  ...
}
```
When you run the container, the main process will run as the user `1001:1001`. If you use `docker exec` to run a command inside the container, you can specify a different user using the `-u` or `--user` flag.
