# {Systemd} user units
by Elliot Holden - elliot@ElliotMyWebGuy.com

__Purpose:__ This lab will demonstrate how __Podman__ can be used to generate a __Systemd user file__ which can be used to manage a container's runtime.Â You will also learn how to automatically update Systemd managed containers (*by using the __io.containers.autoupdate__ lable when initially running a container*). When using Systemd to manage a container's runtime the __enable__ subcommand of the __systemctl__ command can be employed to make sure that the container restarts on reboot of the host system.

Before delving into Systemd we will first look at the *linger* feature of the **loginctl** command to understand how to make command started by one user, *linger* around, even if the user is not logged in. This iwll come in handy when containers started by a particular user needs to be persistant regardless of the user's login status.

1. Login to to any Linux system where __systemd__ is installed (Red Hat, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux etc.) 

2.  Create a new linux user named __nina__ and give the user a password of *__password__*

        sudo useradd nina && sudo passwd nina
3. __ssh__ into localhost as __nina__
        
        ssh nina@localhost

    > __NOTE:__ *As root you may need to enable PasswordAuthentication in __/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/40-disable-passwords.conf__* or the main __sshd_config__ file before you can ssh in with a password.

4. Create the directoy structure __.confg/systemd/user__ if it does not already exist.

        mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user

5. Create a Containerfile that uses docker.io/library/nginx as it's base image

        FROM docker.io/library/nginx \
        LABEL maintainer="Your Name <your@emailaddress.com>"
              description="Systemd Lab"

    >podman build -t custom-nginx .

    * At this point, running __podman images__ should show the container: __localhost/custom-nginx latest__ in the results.

6. Next run a registry container over port 5000.

        podman run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry docker.io/library/registry

7. Updload the __custom-nginx__ image to your registry

        podman push custom-nginx localhost:5000/custom-nginx
        
    __NOTE:__ You may get the following error

   >*Error: trying to reuse blob sha256:98b5f35ea9d3eca6ed1881b5fe5d1e02024e1450822879e4c13bb48c9386d0ad at destination: pinging container registry localhost:5000: Get "https://localhost:5000/v2/": http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client*

   In which case you will need to add the __--tls-verify=false__ option to the __podman push__ command.

        podman push --tls-verify=false custom-nginx localhost:5000/custom-nginx

   Alternatively, you could create a file similar to **/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/my-registry.conf** with the contents:

        [[registry]] 
        location = localhost:5000
        insecure = true

8. Remove the localhost/custom-nginx container

        podman rmi localhost/custom-nginx

8. As __nina__ run the custom-nginx container from the registry you created over port 8888. Make sure to included the __io.containers.autoupdate=registry__ when running the container.

        podman run -d -p 8888:8080 --name nginx localhost:5000/nginx
